# Data Generation #
1. To start with the data generation first make sure you have set up the database (see the README in the root directory).
2. Open up settings.py.example and put in your database credentials
3. Rename settings.py.example to settings.py

This should be all that is necessary to get up and running. The data generation was done with mostly Python and can be generated from commands similar to:

```
python drinkers.py
```

Some of the generation was done with Javascript, but it is detailed in the generation files.
