# Data Generation #
1. To start with the data generation first make sure you have set up the database (see the README in the root directory).
2. Open up settings.py.example and put in your database credentials
3. Rename settings.py.example to settings.py

This should be all that is necessary to get up and running. The data generation was done with mostly Python and can be generated from commands similar to:

```
python drinkers.py
```

Some of the generation was done with Javascript, but it is detailed in the generation files.


### Name generation ###
- Run simply with: python drinkers.py (BeautifulSoup needs to be installed, internet connection needed)
- First and last names are being pulled from the respective text/csv files
- Gender is provided with the names (hard coded to make 20% of names female)
- Age and phone number generated with the random class
- Street name is generated by posting the first name to the Wu-Tang Name Generator (http://www.mess.be/inickgenwuname.php) and scraping the result
- Street number and type (Ave/St/Cir) generated randomly

### Other tables ###
- Towns (for Drinker and Bar) [Kevin - done 11/13]
	- Use wikipedia lists, save to text files. Use google maps api to get lat/lon before generating the other stuff. Save to the text files.
- Drinker(name, address, phone, gender, latitude, longitude, state, city, age) - mostly done, just add lat/lon/town [Kevin - done 11/13]
- Bar(name, address, license, phone, latitude, longitude, state, city) [Kevin - done 11/13]
- Sells(bar, beer, price) [Kevin]
- Beer(name, alcCont, manf) [Pawel - done 11/13]
- SexOffender(name, dateOccured, sexOffendee) [Pawel - done 11/17] - add pattern for past sex offendees to be more likely to be sex offenders, make sexoffendee other gender most of the time
- Frequents(drinker, bar) [Kevin - done 11/16, just need to add primary key]
- Likes(drinker, beer) [Kevin]
- LeftWith(drinker1, drinker2, dateOccurred, bar) [Kevin]
	- this will match up with frequents
	- this should probably also match up with Consumed and SexOffender (date occurred).
	- also need to implement pattern (will do afterwards, that if one person is underage then the other is a sexoffender)
- Manufacturer(name, country) [Pawel - done 11/13]
- Country(name, isAlcProhib) [Pawel - done 11/13]
- Consumed(drinker, bar, date, numDrinks) [Pawel - done 11/17]
