CS336 Databases Project Bitch
=============================

**Name generation**
* Run simply with: python gen.py (BeautifulSoup needs to be installed, internet connection needed)
* First and last names are being pulled from the respective text/csv files
* Gender is provided with the names (hard coded to make 20% of names female)
* Age and phone number generated with the random class
* Street name is generated by posting the first name to the Wu-Tang Name Generator (http://www.mess.be/inickgenwuname.php) and scraping the result
* Street number and type (Ave/St/Cir) generated randomly

TODO: Generate town, state, and zip. Town could be generated by posting to some cool/funny generation app online


**Ideas**
Some of these are difficult to implement but who knows.

* Use the data to determine a safety ranking of bars based off of the number of offences commited at a bar
* Visualize this with a map (not necessarily google maps), if we stick to one state, we could roll our own simple map which just plots each bar and has a heatmap of how dangerous the bars are
* Have a form to report offences
* Have a tool which locates the safest bar in your area to go to
* more to come...
