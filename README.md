CS336 Databases Project Bitch
=============================

* server directory is at /usr/local/httpd-2.2.14/htdocs [this is so gay]
* mysql passwd same as username passwd
* mapped 'main' to put you in the public html directory [only under root though]
* server has python version 2.4.3 so had to use BeautifulSoup version 3...


**Name generation**
* Run simply with: python gen.py (BeautifulSoup needs to be installed, internet connection needed)
* First and last names are being pulled from the respective text/csv files
* Gender is provided with the names (hard coded to make 20% of names female)
* Age and phone number generated with the random class
* Street name is generated by posting the first name to the Wu-Tang Name Generator (http://www.mess.be/inickgenwuname.php) and scraping the result
* Street number and type (Ave/St/Cir) generated randomly

TODO: Generate town, state, and zip. Town could be generated by posting to some cool/funny generation app online


**Ideas**
Some of these are difficult to implement but who knows.

* Use the data to determine a safety ranking of bars based off of the number of offences commited at a bar
* Visualize this with a map (not necessarily google maps), if we stick to one state, we could roll our own simple map which just plots each bar and has a heatmap of how dangerous the bars are
* Have a form to report offences
* Have a tool which locates the safest bar in your area to go to
* If we want to do something with the location, should we have real city/town names with their legitimate zip codes etc? We can get a list of them from [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_in_New_Jersey)

**Time Table**
This week:
- Actually create the tables from our flowchart
- Finish all data generation 
- Enforce all of the patterns we want

Next week:
- Make the backend (probably in PHP)
- Make forms to report offences, etc.
- Make at least a couple visualizations of most dangerous areas
- Add profiles of sex offenders
- Real town names from NJ, NY, PA
- Possibly use [google heatmap](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/layer-heatmap)


Towns (for Drinker and Bar) [Kevin]
- Use wikipedia lists, save to text files. Use google maps api to get lat/lon before generating the other stuff. Save to the text files.

Drinker - mostly done, just add lat/lon/town

Bar [Kevin] 

Beer [Pawel]

SexOffender [Pawel] - add pattern for past sex offendees to be more likely to be sex offenders, make sexoffendee other gender most of the time
